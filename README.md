Attract Mode: Ol Room 4x3 theme layout
Original post: http://forum.attractmode.org/index.php?topic=1260.0

This wasn't originally my theme. This is based off of OlRoom theme found here: 
http://forum.attractmode.org/index.php?topic=926.15
Please give them the credit for the original. 
Apologies to the original creators for the liberties I've taken with their work. 
OlRoom was done very well, but it doesn't work for my setup, so I had to create my own versions. 
Since my themes are 4:3 and use slightly different code I decided to create my own thread. 

## Features: 
- Themes are 4:3 ratio
- Does not use a spinning wheel (but does use wheel logos)
- Contains changed console images and controller images. 
- I tried to adjust the scaling and perspective to be in tighter range.
- Image/Names are based on US console versions

These themes all assume the use of Hyperspin & Emumovies assets for videosnaps, flyers, etc. 
I'll note what is required in the description of each one. 

I've made a unified layout so you only need one theme folder to handle multiple emulators. 

It displays: 

- Atari 2600
- Intellivision
- Nintendo NES
- Nintendo SNES
- Nintendo 64
- Sega Genesis
- Sony Playstation
- ScummVM
- Generic PC
- Generic TV

If you want any other system added to this theme please let me know.

### Usage Instructions: 
There are 2 methods: 

a. Name your lists like the above and it will change styles automatically when switching between supported emulators. 
I was unable to find a dynamic method within AttractMode to change the style based on the emulator 
(the variables were only for display, not for evaluation) so it changes based on list name. 

b. If you don't want to use specific list names, duplicate the layout 
(name it whatever you want) and set the "Selected System" option to the specific style you want.

I've noticed a few scaling issues with the "played time" I'll be fixing that soon.
